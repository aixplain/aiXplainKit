    Logs a message.
     
     - Parameters:
        - input: The message to log.
        - messageLogLevel: The log severity level for the message. If nil, uses the logger's default log level.
        - filename: The name of the file from which the message was logged.
        - line: The line number from which the message was logged.
        - columns: The column number from which the message was logged.
        - functionName: The name of the function from which the message was logged.
     - Returns: The message that was logged or nil if the message was filtered out based on the log severity level.

     This method logs a message to the console and stores a new LogEntry object with the message content, log severity level, category, function name, and timestamp. The log severity level is determined by the "messageLogLevel" parameter or, if nil, by the logger's default log level. The log entry is then added to the logger's session entries. If the message is filtered out based on the log severity level, the method returns nil. Otherwise, it returns the message that was logged.
