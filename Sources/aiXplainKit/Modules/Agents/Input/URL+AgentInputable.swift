/// Extends the `URL` type to conform to the `AgentInputable` protocol.
///
/// This allows URLs to be used as inputs for agents, enabling them to handle file paths, HTTP links,
/// or S3 URIs dynamically. It includes functionality for generating payloads and handling uploads to S3 storage.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - using: The `AgentRunParameters` containing additional configuration for the agent execution.
    ///   - id: An optional session ID to include in the payload.

    ///   - `ModelError.failToGenerateAFilePayload` if the payload cannot be serialized to JSON.
